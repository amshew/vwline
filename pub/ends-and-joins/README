A separate document that describes the algorithms employed to handle
line ending styles and line join styles for variable-width lines
(applies to all 'vwline' functions for end styles, 
 plus vwline() for join styles).

- round ends and round joins NOT necessarily arcs of circles
  => bezier approximations

- mitre joins NOT necessarily a single intersection point

- ADD mitre end style (with mitre limit as for mitre joins)

- inside corners NOT necessarily a single intersection point
  => follow simple algorithm along line edges then polysimplify()

  <p>
    The deciding factor in deciding how to handle inner joins was
    "symmetry" (does the line look the same if the x/y locations,
    and widths, are reversed?).
