+ Created docker image with (NOTE ONLY lowercase in image tag) ...

  sudo docker build -t pmur002/power-curve .

  - NOTE that I had to edit /etc/default/docker to enable ...

    DOCKER_OPTS="--dns 130.216.190.1"

    ... and restart the docker server ...

    sudo service docker restart

    ... so that the docker build would use the UoA DNS server
    (otherwise the build fails at the first apt-update)

+ To test image interactively 
  (which is useful for testing that various things will run and installing
   packages interactively before adding them to the Dockerfile) ...

   E.G., test that the report will build !!!

  sudo docker run -v /home/pmur002/Files/Research/Rstuff/VWline/vwline/pub/vwline-intro:/home/work/ -w /home/work --rm -t -i pmur002/power-curve /bin/bash

+ To make image available on DockerHub ...

  sudo docker login
  sudo docker push pmur002/power-curve

+ Build report with ...

  make docker
